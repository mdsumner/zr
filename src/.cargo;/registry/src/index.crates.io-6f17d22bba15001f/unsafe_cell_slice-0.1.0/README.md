A Rust microlibrary for creating multiple mutable references to a `slice`.

### Motivation
The rust borrow checker forbids creating multiple mutable references of a `slice`.
For example, this fails to compile with ```cannot borrow `data` as mutable more than once at a time```:
```rust
let mut data = vec![0u8; 2];
let data_a: &mut [u8] = data.as_mut_slice();
let data_b: &mut [u8] = data.as_mut_slice();
data_a[0] = 0;
data_b[1] = 1;
```

There are use cases for acquiring multiple mutable references to a `slice`, such as for writing independent elements in parallel.
A safe approach is to borrow non-overlapping slices via `slice::split_at_mut`, `slice::chunks_mut`, etc.
However, such approaches may not be applicable in complicated use cases, such as writing to interleaved elements.

### `UnsafeCellSlice`
An `UnsafeCellSlice` can be created from a mutable slice or the spare capacity in a `Vec`.
It has an unsafe `as_mut_slice` method that permits creating multiple mutable `slice` references.

```rust
let mut data = vec![0u8; 2];
{
    let data = UnsafeCellSlice::new(&mut data);
    let data_a: &mut [u8] = unsafe { data.as_mut_slice() };
    let data_b: &mut [u8] = unsafe { data.as_mut_slice() };
    data_a[0] = 0;
    data_b[1] = 1;
}
assert_eq!(data[0], 0);
assert_eq!(data[1], 1);
```

Note that this is very unsafe and bypasses Rust's safety guarantees!
It is the responsibility of the caller of `UnsafeCellSlice::as_mut_slice()` to avoid data races and undefined behavior.

Under the hood, `UnsafeCellSlice` is a reference to a `std::cell::UnsafeCell` slice, hence the name of the crate.
